# ESE_205
This is an innovative project which was designed and implemented in Fall 2017. It aims to provide a more pleasant way of waking up by lifting up user's window shades at preset time. It can also serve as weather and time reminder. It is able to automatically fetch these data from internet based on user's location input. Local time and weather was updated from time to time. 

Detailed description of the project can be found https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/ese205/core/index.php?title=Sunlight_Alarm.
